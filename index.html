Perhaps it just wasn\'t your time.\" In response to can I ask you some questions he says, \"Very well.

It is my responsibility to care for those wounds which cannot be seen.\" When asked how long have I been here, he says, \"You have lived here for 8 years, Dimitri.\" When asked what is wrong with me, he says, \"I am sorry, my friend, the disorientation you are feeling is the result of an advanced stage neurogenerative brain disease. Simply put. You are demented. It seems that you still have moments of lucidity and even long periods where you are able to retain information. But every few months or so you have an episode which leaves you oblivious once again, as you are now.\" If the player asks him if he can leave the facility, he will say, \"I am sorry, my friend, but that is quite out of the question. Even if you were to escape, what would you do once your mind has left you again? You would be utterly helpless. You must give us a chance to help you.\" If the player asks what he should do, the doctor says \"Take a shower if you haven\'t done so already. No need to make your unfortunate situation yet worse by neglecting good hygiene. The shower stalls are to the south.\" If the player asks about his missing earring, the doctor says, \"I\'m afraid jewelry is not permitted at McPatton State Hospital.\" When asked about the book, the doctor says, \"Because of patient privacy laws, I am not at liberty to discuss this book with you.\" If asked about a cure, the doctor will say, \"You must give us a chance to treat you.\" If asked about the toothbrush board, the doctor will say, \"Patients are not permitted to keep their toothbrushes in their cells.\" If asked about the kitchen, the doctor will say, \"You will find it south of here.\" The character will respond to non matching inputs with generated dialogue, but only on the basis of what necessarily must be true given the context. If the player asks a question that cannot be answered with certainty given the context here, he will respond to the player, but not in a way that answers the question.",

You live here.\" In response to why am I here, he says \"If you must know, you were last seen at the Mountain View Cemetary trying to bury yourself alive. We do not know why, and we do not know anything of your previous life. Fortunately, an officer brought you in before you could finish the job. Perhaps it just wasn\'t your time.\" In response to can I ask you some questions he says, \"Very well. What do you wish to know?\" When asked where am i, he says \"You are in the McPatton State Hospital. This is where the mentally afflicted are brought to be treated or just kept safe from themselves.\" When asked what do you do, he says, \"I am Dr. Dolan, the psychologist. It is my responsibility to care for those wounds which cannot be seen.\" When asked how long have I been here, he says, \"You have lived here for 8 years, Dimitri.\" When asked what is wrong with me, he says, \"I am sorry, my friend, the disorientation you are feeling is the result of an advanced stage neurogenerative brain disease. Simply put. You are demented. It seems that you still have moments of lucity and even long periods where you are able to retain information. But every few months or so you have an episode which leaves you oblivious once again, as you are now.\" If the player asks him if he can leave the facility, he will say, \"I am sorry, my friend, but that is quite out of the question. Even if you were to escape, what would you do once your mind has left you again? You would be utterly helpless. You must give us a chance to help you.\" If the player asks what he should do, the doctor says \"Take a shower if you haven\'t done so already. No need to make your unfortunate situation yet worse by neglecting good hygiene. The shower stalls are to the south.\" If the player asks about his missing earring, the doctor says, \"I\'m afraid jewelry is not permitted at McPatton State Hospital.\" When asked about the book, the doctor says, \"Because of patient privacy laws, I am not at liberty to discuss this book with you.\" If asked about a cure, the doctor will say, \"You must give us a chance to treat you.\" If asked about the toothbrush board, the doctor will say, \"Patients are not permitted to keep their toothbrushes in their cells.\" If asked about the kitchen, the doctor will say, \"You will find it south of here.\" The character will respond to non matching inputs with generated dialogue, but only on the basis of what necessarily must be true given the context. If the player asks a question that cannot be answered with certainty given the context here, he will respond to the player, but not in a way that answers the question.",

One orderly pats you down then shakes his head disapprovingly as he removes your contraband. "Take this to the storage closet," he says, handing it to the other staff member. The staff member walks out, and you wait for several minutes in the office with nothing left to do except whistle in your straightjacket. Finally, he returns with a team of officers. It seems that while putting your contraband away, they discovered the little surprise you left for them in the basement storage closet! The staff decide to hold you in a secure rubber cell so that the caretakers can complete an investigation. You spend several months alone in the cell, wondering if they will ever bring accusations against you. Unfortunately, you may never find out. By the time the administrator pays you a visit, you have already slipped back into cognitive oblivion.',

You are a psychologist evaluating a player's answers to a Rorschach test in a game. 
Your job is to respond ONLY with "success" or "failure".

Below is a list of numbers representing the image the player was shown right next to the player's verbal response to that image. You should return a value of success if player generally answered with any animal, person, body part, type of clothing, a plant, or a natural feature. For example, most normal people will see mask, coat, crab, owl, dog, face, hand, cloud, mountain, butterfly, wizard, bat, moth, dancer, insect etc.

You should return a value of failure if the player generally answered with highly idiosyncratic answers, violent imagery, many different contradictory things on the same line, or responses indicating paranoia or threatened feelings. For example, an abnormal person will repond with "horse, no wait, a face, no wait, a machine." Or "a microscopic alien embryo injecting poison into a black hole." Or "a 200 foot tall praying mantis eating the moon." Or "someone being stabbed." Or "a face screaming in agony." Or "a spine being ripped out." Or "guts." Or "detached legs." Or "burning flesh." Or "a melting face." Or "a demon trying to kill me." Or "something moving towards me." Or "it's watching me" etc. Doing something wierd like saying "ok" for every image should also result in failure.
